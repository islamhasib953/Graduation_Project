## Notes
- **Recipient Clarification**: Notifications listed with "Parent" as the recipient are sent to the parent (User) associated with the child (`childId`) specified in the notification. Each notification is linked to a specific child, allowing multiple children per parent to have independent notifications (e.g., medicine reminders, vaccinations).
- **Immediate** notifications are sent as soon as the triggering action occurs.
- **Scheduled** notifications are managed by `node-cron` jobs in `scheduleNotifications.js` and are checked every minute or at specific times (e.g., 8:00 AM, 10:00 AM).
- Notifications are stored in the `Notification` collection in MongoDB with fields like `status` ("pending", "sent", "failed") and `sentAt` to track their state and prevent duplicates.
- The system uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send push notifications, requiring a valid `fcmToken` for each recipient (parent or doctor).

## Testing Instructions
To test notifications from the frontend (e.g., Flutter):
1. Ensure Firebase is configured correctly in both backend (`firebase-config.js`) and frontend.
2. Send the `fcmToken` from the frontend to the backend via `/api/users/save-fcm-token`.
3. Trigger immediate notifications (e.g., login, update profile) and verify receipt on the parent's device.
4. Add test data (e.g., medicines with near-future times, vaccinations with today's due date) to trigger scheduled notifications for specific children.
5. Check the `Notification` collection in MongoDB to verify storage, status, and association with the correct `childId`.
